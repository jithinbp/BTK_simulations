BTK_simulations
===============

Simulations of some curves from the Blonder, Tinkham , Klapwikj Theory of electron transport in metal-superconductor interfaces

pgTandR.py depends on pygame and python-grace.  Scroll on the pygame window to change the width of the barrier between the metal and the superconductor. Traces will automatically refresh, and will show the various probabilities of the electrons' possible behavior at the interface.
